Section 0: The filesystem

All PyX compliant systems must have a root directory(/), a sys(/sys) directory in the root(/)
directory, a user(/user) directory in the root(/) directory, and a credits.txt file in the
root(/) directory. In the sys(/sys) directory there must be a bin(/sys/bin) directory, a
rescue(/sys/rescue) directory and a syslog.txt file in the sys(/sys) directory. In the
user(/user) directory there must be a bin(/user/bin) directory in the user(/user) directory
and a write(/user/write) directory in the user(/user) directory.

In the sysbin(/sys/bin) directory, the following packages are to be stored:

- npim
- cat
- ls
- pwd
- cd
- help
- whoami
- touch

In the sysrescue(/sys/rescue) directory, the following packages are to be stored:

- pyboot
- pyfs
- exit
- rm

In the userbin(/user/bin) directory, the following packages are to be stored:

- pyfetch

The userwrite(/user/write) directory is to be stored in two lists, one named
'userwrite' with the following value: [] and another list named 'usercont' with the
following value: []. When a user adds a text file, you are to add it's filename to
the userwrite list, and its contents are to be added to the usercont list.

To navigate the filesystem, the user is to use the 'cd' command. The 'cd' command is to
support entering full directory paths, and it is to support entering sub-directories
without specifying the full path, as shown in exibit A:

Exibit A:

location: /user
contents: /bin /write

user: cd bin

location: /user/bin

The 'cd' command is also to support going back up one directory path using the 'cd ..'
command as shown in exibit B:

Exibit B:

location: /user/bin

user: cd ..

location: /user

To create a file the user must be in the userwrite(/user/write) directory and can create
a file with the 'touch <filename>' command or using 'npim <filename>' command. To remove
a file, the user must be in the userwrite(/user/write) directory and can use the
'rm <filename>' command. To read the contents of a file, the user does not need to be in
the userwrite(/user/write), they can use the 'cat <filename>' command.

Section 1: The kernel

All PyX compliant systems must use PyKern as its' kernel, and must use MemSafe as it's
memory managment system. All PyX  compliant systems must also support booting into the kernel
with the 'exit' command. PyX systems are to NEVER change the functionality of PyKern unless
it is to integrate a filesystem.

Section 2: External configuration

All PyX compliant systems are to pull the following vaules from an external configuration
file:

- username
- hostname
- boot message

These values are to be stored in the following variables in the configuration file:

username: username
hostname: hname
bootmessage: bmess
